<!-- CHECK IF: External stakeholders such as Patient, Insurance, Lab Technicians/Scientist and Pharmacy come into the factors for this system. -->

- **Doctors:** <span align=justify>Doctors are the primary care for all patients. With them attending a number of patients and maintaining a strong relationship with them, while attending their case, a doctor may find it troubling to keep record of their patient on files and papers. They also need to make the process of retrival easier. And lastly, they need a concise and neat picture of who and what the patient is?, what the severity of the patient case?, how many time have the patient visited them prior to current meet or date.</span>

- **Nurses:** <span align=justify>Nurses are the secondary or supporting care for all patients. They are the substitute when a doctor is not able to attend a patient's case due to the meeting of an another severe case. During an emergency when a doctor is not available, a nurse may need to understand the details about their patient. Especially the patient vital. On checking, they are able to give a proper emergency medication depending on the condition and illness patient is suffering.</span>

- **Practice management:** <span align=justify>he Practice Manager is responsible for everything else that occurs during a patient encounter. From the organizing and optimizing of patient flow, office workflows, to procedures and tasks. The mission of the practice manager is to allow the doctor to remain focused on treating patients, minus the burden of running the office.

The responsibilities of a practice manager stretch across administrative, legal, financial, technological and more.</span>
